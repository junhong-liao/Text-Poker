Welcome to my game project (Video Poker)!

How to Play (Regular):

Enter your name, then choose a number of tokens to bet.

You'll then be dealt 5 random cards. 

If, for whatever reason, you don't like your cards, you can remove up to all five of them - once!

You'll be dealt new cards equal to the number of cards you deleted.

When shaping your hand, keep in mind the winning card combinations:

Royal Flush (win 250x your bet): hand containing cards 10 through Ace, all of the same suit.
Straight Flush (win 50x your bet): hand containing five consecutively ranked cards, all of the same suit.
Four of a Kind (win 25x your bet): hand containing four cards of the same rank.
Full House (win 9x your bet): hand containing any two cards of the same rank, and three different cards of the same rank.
Flush (win 6x your bet): hand containing five cards of the same suit.
Straight (win 4x your bet): hand containing five cards of consecutive rank.
Three of a Kind (win 4x your bet): hand containing three cards of the same value.
Two Pairs (win 2x your bet): hand containing two pairs of two cards of the same rank.

How to Test the Program (Debugging):

Initially, this feature was added for debugging purposes. Now, you can use it to test out a hand, or my overall program!

Hearts, Diamonds, Clubs, and Spades can be represented with the letters 'h', 'd', 'c', and 's'

Cards numbered 2 through Ace can be represented with the numbers 2 - 14.

The Ace card can be used as a '1' or a '14': for example: s14 c2 d3 h4 s5 is a straight, and c10 d11 h12 s13 s14 is also a straight.

To test a potential hand, simply run the program in command line: java Poker [hand], where [hand] represents any five cards of any suit and rank of your choosing.
